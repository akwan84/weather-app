# Weather App
This is a weather app that I created using ReactJS using the following 3 APIs from [openweathermap.org](openweathermap.org).

* [Geocoding](https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api)
* [Current Weather](https://openweathermap.org/current)
* [5 Day Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5)

# Installation and Running
To install the project, you will require [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/) (version shouldn't matter, but the version I am using is 8.15.0). With that installed, navigate to the root of the project folder and install the dependencies with 

```bash
npm install
```


Another thing you're going to need is an API key from OpenWeather, which you can do [here](https://openweathermap.org/price). Free tier is perfectly fine. 

With that key, first copy the `.env.example` file and name it `.env`:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
add the API key to the `REACT_APP_API_KEY` in `.env`.

Then to run the project:
```bash
npm start
```
which should provide you with a link to the webpage.
# Features
